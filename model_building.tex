\section{Model Building}

The Altruistic Effectiveness Metric (AEM) was developed through a rigorous mathematical framework that combines multiple financial indicators into a single, normalized score. The model's foundation lies in the principle that a charity's effectiveness can be quantified through a weighted combination of key financial metrics, each carefully normalized and adjusted for statistical robustness.

\subsection{Mathematical Framework}

The core AEM score is calculated as a weighted sum of six normalized components:

\begin{equation}
    \text{AEM} = \sum_{i=1}^{6} w_i \cdot f_i(x_i)
\end{equation}

where $w_i$ represents the weight of each component and $f_i(x_i)$ is the normalized score for each metric. The weights are carefully calibrated based on industry standards and expert consensus:

\begin{equation}
    \sum_{i=1}^{6} w_i = 1
\end{equation}

\subsection{Normalization and Statistical Adjustments}

To ensure comparability across organizations of different sizes and characteristics, each component undergoes sophisticated normalization using a sigmoid function:

\begin{equation}
    f(x) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-\beta(x - \alpha)}}
\end{equation}

where $\alpha$ represents the shift parameter and $\beta$ controls the steepness of the normalization curve. This approach provides several advantages over traditional linear normalization:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Smooth transition between score ranges
    \item Bounded output between 0 and 1
    \item Robust handling of outliers
\end{itemize}

For small organizations, we apply Bayesian shrinkage to reduce the impact of statistical noise:

\begin{equation}
    \text{Adjusted Score} = \frac{n}{n + k} \cdot \text{Raw Score} + \frac{k}{n + k} \cdot \mu_0
\end{equation}

where $n$ represents the organization's size (total revenue), $k$ is a smoothing constant, and $\mu_0$ is the prior mean.

\subsection{Component Metrics}

The model incorporates six key metrics, each with specific normalization parameters:

\textbf{Metric} & \textbf{Weight} & \textbf{Normalization Parameters} \\

Program Expense Ratio & 0.30 & $\alpha = 0.7$, $\beta = 10$ \\
Fundraising Efficiency & 0.20 & $\alpha = 0.5$, $\beta = 10$ \\
Revenue Sustainability & 0.15 & $\alpha = 0.5$, $\beta = 10$ \\
Net Surplus Margin & 0.15 & $\alpha = 0.1$, $\beta = 10$ \\
Executive Pay Reasonableness & 0.10 & $\alpha = 0.5$, $\beta = 10$ \\

\subsection{Confidence Intervals}

To account for measurement uncertainty, the model provides confidence intervals for each AEM score:

\begin{equation}
    \text{CI} = \text{AEM} \pm \frac{0.05}{\sqrt{n}}
\end{equation}

where $n$ represents the organization's total revenue. This approach acknowledges that larger organizations typically have more reliable financial data.

This sophisticated mathematical framework provides a robust and nuanced assessment of charitable effectiveness, accounting for both absolute performance and relative context while maintaining statistical rigor and interpretability.
