\section{Model Building}

The Altruistic Effectiveness Metric (AEM) was developed through a rigorous mathematical framework that combines multiple financial indicators into a single, normalized score. The model's foundation lies in the principle that a charity's effectiveness can be quantified through a weighted combination of key financial metrics, each carefully normalized and adjusted for statistical robustness.

\subsection{Mathematical Framework}

The core AEM score is calculated as a weighted sum of six normalized components:

\begin{equation}
    \text{AEM} = \sum_{i=1}^{6} w_i \cdot f_i(x_i)
\end{equation}

where $w_i$ represents the weight of each component and $f_i(x_i)$ is the normalized score for each metric. The weights are carefully calibrated based on both base importance and information content:

\begin{equation}
    w_i = \frac{w_i^{\text{base}} + w_i^{\text{entropy}}}{2}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Multi-Dimensional Normalization}

To ensure comparability across organizations while accounting for metric correlations, we employ a sophisticated multi-dimensional normalization approach based on Mahalanobis distance principles:

\begin{equation}
    \mathbf{z} = \frac{\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{\mu}}{\mathbf{\sigma}}
\end{equation}

where $\mathbf{x}$ is the vector of raw metrics, $\mathbf{\mu}$ is the mean vector, and $\mathbf{\sigma}$ is the standard deviation vector. This z-score normalization is then transformed into the unit interval using a sigmoid function:

\begin{equation}
    f(\mathbf{z}) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-\beta(\mathbf{z} - \alpha)}}
\end{equation}

This approach provides several advantages:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Accounts for correlations between metrics
    \item Maintains relative distances between organizations
    \item Ensures bounded output between 0 and 1
    \item Provides smooth transitions between score ranges
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Entropy-Based Weighting}

The model employs Shannon entropy to determine the information content of each metric, with a small constant $\epsilon$ added to prevent zero probabilities:

\begin{equation}
    p_i(x) = \frac{x_i + \epsilon}{\sum_{j=1}^{6} (x_j + \epsilon)}
\end{equation}

The entropy weight for each metric is then calculated as:

\begin{equation}
    w_i^{\text{entropy}} = \frac{H_i + \epsilon}{\sum_{j=1}^{6} (H_j + \epsilon)}
\end{equation}

where $\epsilon = 10^{-10}$ ensures numerical stability.

\subsection{Multi-Dimensional Normalization}

The multi-dimensional normalization process includes several safeguards:

\begin{equation}
    \mathbf{z} = 
    \begin{cases}
    \text{clip}\left(\frac{\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{\mu}}{\mathbf{\sigma}}, -3, 3\right) & \text{if } \mathbf{\sigma} \neq 0 \\
    0.5 & \text{otherwise}
    \end{cases}
\end{equation}

This ensures that:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Extreme values are clipped to prevent distortion
    \item Identical values result in neutral scores
    \item Zero standard deviation is handled gracefully
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Policy Evaluation}

The transparency component evaluates four key policies with equal weights:

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|}
\hline
\textbf{Policy} & \textbf{Weight} \\
\hline
Conflict of Interest & 0.25 \\
Whistleblower & 0.25 \\
Document Retention & 0.25 \\
Compensation Review & 0.25 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Policy Weights for Transparency Evaluation}
\label{tab:policy_weights}
\end{table}

The transparency score is calculated as:

\begin{equation}
    \text{Transparency} = \frac{1}{4}\sum_{k=1}^{4} \mu_k(p_k)
\end{equation}

where $\mu_k(p_k)$ is 1 if policy $k$ is implemented and 0 otherwise.

\subsection{Component Metrics}

The model incorporates six key metrics, each with specific normalization parameters:

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|}
\hline
\textbf{Metric} & \textbf{Base Weight} & \textbf{Normalization Parameters} \\
\hline
Program Expense Ratio & 0.30 & Ideal = 0.6, $\beta = 3$ \\
Fundraising Efficiency & 0.20 & Log scale, Ideal = 0.8, $\beta = 3$ \\
Revenue Sustainability & 0.15 & Ideal = 0.5, $\beta = 3$ \\
Net Surplus Margin & 0.15 & Ideal = 0.05, $\beta = 3$ \\
Executive Pay Reasonableness & 0.10 & Ideal = 0.015, $\beta = 3$ \\
Transparency & 0.10 & Binary, $\beta = 3$ \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Component Metrics and Their Parameters}
\label{tab:metrics}
\end{table}

\subsection{Normalization Functions}

Each metric is normalized using a sigmoid function with specific parameters:

\begin{equation}
    f(x) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-\beta(x - \alpha)}}
\end{equation}

where $\alpha$ is the ideal value and $\beta$ controls the steepness of the transition. For fundraising efficiency, we use a logarithmic transformation:

\begin{equation}
    f_{\text{fundraising}}(x) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-\beta(\log_{10}(x) - \alpha)}}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Mathematical Properties}

The AEM model satisifies several important mathematical properties:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Boundedness}: All scores are bounded between 0 and 1
    \begin{equation}
        0 \leq \text{AEM} \leq 1
    \end{equation}
    
    \item \textbf{Monotonicity}: The score increases with improvements in any component
    \begin{equation}
        \frac{\partial \text{AEM}}{\partial x_i} \geq 0 \quad \forall i
    \end{equation}
    
    \item \textbf{Continuity}: The score function is continuous in all its arguments
    \begin{equation}
        \lim_{x_i \to a} \text{AEM}(x_1, \ldots, x_i, \ldots, x_6) = \text{AEM}(x_1, \ldots, a, \ldots, x_6)
    \end{equation}
    
    \item \textbf{Sensitivity}: The model is sensitive to changes in all components
    \begin{equation}
        \frac{\partial^2 \text{AEM}}{\partial x_i^2} \neq 0 \quad \forall i
    \end{equation}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Confidence Intervals}

To account for measurement uncertainty, the model provides confidence intervals for each AEM score:

\begin{equation}
    \text{CI} = \text{AEM} \pm \frac{0.05}{\sqrt{n}}
\end{equation}

where $n$ represents the organization's total revenue. This approach acknowledges that larger organizations typically have more reliable financial data.
