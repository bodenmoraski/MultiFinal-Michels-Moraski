\section{Model Building}

The Altruistic Effectiveness Metric (AEM) was developed through a rigorous mathematical framework that combines multiple financial indicators into a single, normalized score. The model's foundation lies in the principle that a charity's effectiveness can be quantified through a weighted combination of key financial metrics, each carefully normalized and adjusted for statistical robustness.

\subsection{Mathematical Framework}

The core AEM score is calculated as a weighted sum of six normalized components:

\begin{equation}
    \text{AEM} = \sum_{i=1}^{6} w_i \cdot f_i(x_i)
\end{equation}

where $w_i$ represents the weight of each component and $f_i(x_i)$ is the normalized score for each metric. The weights are carefully calibrated based on both base importance and information content:

\begin{equation}
    w_i = \frac{w_i^{\text{base}} + w_i^{\text{entropy}}}{2}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Multi-Dimensional Normalization}

To ensure comparability across organizations while accounting for metric correlations, we employ a sophisticated multi-dimensional normalization approach based on Mahalanobis distance principles:

\begin{equation}
    \bm{z} = \frac{\bm{x} - \bm{\mu}}{\bm{\sigma}}
\end{equation}

where $\bm{x}$ is the vector of raw metrics, $\bm{\mu}$ is the mean vector, and $\bm{\sigma}$ is the standard deviation vector. This z-score normalization is then transformed into the unit interval using a sigmoid function:

\begin{equation}
    f(\bm{z}) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-\beta(\bm{z} - \alpha)}}
\end{equation}

This approach provides several advantages:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Accounts for correlations between metrics
    \item Maintains relative distances between organizations
    \item Ensures bounded output between 0 and 1
    \item Provides smooth transitions between score ranges
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Entropy-Based Weighting}

The model employs Shannon entropy to determine the information content of each metric:

\begin{equation}
    H(X) = -\sum_{x \in X} p(x) \log_2 p(x)
\end{equation}

For each metric $i$, we calculate its entropy weight as:

\begin{equation}
    w_i^{\text{entropy}} = \frac{H_i}{\sum_{j=1}^{6} H_j}
\end{equation}

This ensures that metrics with higher information content receive greater weight in the final score. The entropy calculation is performed on the probability distribution of each metric's values:

\begin{equation}
    p_i(x) = \frac{x_i}{\sum_{j=1}^{6} x_j}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Fuzzy Logic Policy Evaluation}

The transparency component employs fuzzy logic to evaluate organizational policies:

\begin{equation}
    \text{Transparency} = \sum_{k=1}^{4} w_k \cdot \mu_k(p_k)
\end{equation}

where $w_k$ are the policy weights and $\mu_k(p_k)$ is the membership function for policy $k$. The membership function is defined as:

\begin{equation}
    \mu_k(p_k) = 
    \begin{cases}
    1 & \text{if policy } k \text{ is implemented} \\
    0 & \text{otherwise}
    \end{cases}
\end{equation}

The policy weights are calibrated based on their relative importance:

\begin{tabular}{|l|c|}
\hline
\textbf{Policy} & \textbf{Weight} \\
\hline
Conflict of Interest & 0.3 \\
Whistleblower & 0.3 \\
Document Retention & 0.2 \\
Compensation Review & 0.2 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Policy Weights for Fuzzy Logic Evaluation}

\end{table}

\subsection{Component Metrics}

The model incorporates six key metrics, each with specific normalization parameters:

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|}
\hline
\textbf{Metric} & \textbf{Base Weight} & \textbf{Normalization Parameters} \\
\hline
Program Expense Ratio & 0.30 & $\alpha = 0.7$, $\beta = 10$ \\
Fundraising Efficiency & 0.20 & $\alpha = 0.5$, $\beta = 10$ \\
Revenue Sustainability & 0.15 & $\alpha = 0.5$, $\beta = 10$ \\
Net Surplus Margin & 0.15 & $\alpha = 0.1$, $\beta = 10$ \\
Executive Pay Reasonableness & 0.10 & $\alpha = 0.5$, $\beta = 10$ \\
Transparency & 0.10 & $\alpha = 0.5$, $\beta = 10$ \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

\end{table}

\subsection{Mathematical Properties}

The AEM model satisfies several important mathematical properties:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Boundedness}: All scores are bounded between 0 and 1
    \begin{equation}
        0 \leq \text{AEM} \leq 1
    \end{equation}
    
    \item \textbf{Monotonicity}: The score increases with improvements in any component
    \begin{equation}
        \frac{\partial \text{AEM}}{\partial x_i} \geq 0 \quad \forall i
    \end{equation}
    
    \item \textbf{Continuity}: The score function is continuous in all its arguments
    \begin{equation}
        \lim_{x_i \to a} \text{AEM}(x_1, \ldots, x_i, \ldots, x_6) = \text{AEM}(x_1, \ldots, a, \ldots, x_6)
    \end{equation}
    
    \item \textbf{Sensitivity}: The model is sensitive to changes in all components
    \begin{equation}
        \frac{\partial^2 \text{AEM}}{\partial x_i^2} \neq 0 \quad \forall i
    \end{equation}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Confidence Intervals}

To account for measurement uncertainty, the model provides confidence intervals for each AEM score:

\begin{equation}
    \text{CI} = \text{AEM} \pm \frac{0.05}{\sqrt{n}}
\end{equation}

where $n$ represents the organization's total revenue. This approach acknowledges that larger organizations typically have more reliable financial data.
