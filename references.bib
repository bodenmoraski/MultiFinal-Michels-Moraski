  abstract = {Despite the popularity of not-for-profit organizations (NFPs) as a research topic, existing comprehensive reviews are rather limited, resulting in a large body of literature that lacks integration. In this review, we summarize prior research on NFPs, focusing on four key differences between for-profit organizations and NFPs: organizational goals, financial resources, human resources, and leadership and governance. Our aims are to delineate the major inroads that have been made—not only in theory testing, but also in theory building—and to identify fruitful avenues for continued inquiry.}

abstract = {Building on prior research characterizing organizational effectiveness as a social construction, this article identifies the perceived attributes of effective transnational nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) and the leadership values associated with higher reputations for organizational effectiveness. Results are based on an in-depth, mixed-method interview study of 152 NGO leaders located in the United States and representing all major sectors of organizational activity. Among the twenty-nine attributes that leaders identified in peer organizations that they regarded as particularly effective, leaders stressed instantiation of sound principles or strategy, a grassroots approach, large organizational size and resources, being collaborative, singleness of focus, campaigning abilities, funding and fundraising prowess, global scope, and quality people. Furthermore, statistical analysis reveals that NGOs with leaders who value similarities with peer organizations, grassroots approaches, diversity of strategies, dedication, professionalism, and distributed organizational structures have significantly higher reputations for effectiveness.},

We posit that there are four reporting factors related to donations. The factors are the efficiency of the organization in allocating resources to its programs, the financial stability of the organization, the information available to donors, and the reputation of the organization. We use factor analysis with variables from previous studies and find that the variables align on four components that appear to represent the factors that we conceptualize.}

	abstract = {Theories of nonprofit density have assumed a variety of dispositions toward the state, including opposition, suspicion, indifference, and mutual dependence. In this article, we conduct the first large-scale simultaneous empirical test of the two most prominent nonprofit theories: government failure theory and interdependence theory. The former characterizes nonprofit activities as substitute or oppositional to state programs, accounting for the limitations and failures of government-provided services and more reflective of the heterogeneity of demand for services. The latter emphasizes the more complementary and collaborative nature of nonprofit activities, focusing on the overlapping agendas of nonprofits and the state and the mutual dependency that arises from partnership. The theories are difficult to test empirically because both predict the same relationship between state capacity and the size of the nonprofit sector, albeit for theoretically distinct reasons. A true joint test requires the separation of government support from private support for nonprofits. Using a newly constructed panel dataset in which we separate out nonprofit revenue sources normally agglomerated in the Internal Revenue Service 990 data, we examine the empirical merits of both theories to answer the question of whether human service nonprofit organizations thrive when government fails or when government collaborates. Our findings suggest that government funding has a more favorable effect on nonprofit density than private donations. The findings raise several policy and management implications that need evaluation.},
